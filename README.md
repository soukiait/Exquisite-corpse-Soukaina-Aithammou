# Dreams
- Human can never stop dreaming Dream is food for the soul just as food is food for the body.

- We often see during our existence our dreams are disappointed and our desires are frustrated.

- But we must continue to dream else soul dies in us.

- Dream is like a fuel to move forward.

- Feel ourself and follow your dream.

- You will reach your destination.
